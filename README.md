# Install

Clone this repository to any `path` on your machine and them add this to your shell init file (e.g. `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`):

```
alias ag="HOME=`path` git" 
```

Then you can use any git command and aliases in this configuration through `ag` alias. You can substitute `ag` for whatever alias you want as well.
